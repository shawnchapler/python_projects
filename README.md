These python samples were done for a masters in data science program.  It was my first exposure to python (Spring 2017).  The various files reflect the following:

Assignment 2:  Loops and Elif Statements
Assignment 9:  Use of pandas and numpy to cleanse file and add new columns before outputing the data for further analysis in R.
Assignment 10:  Use of pandas and numpy to cleanse file, define functions, and perform timings on the code.
Assignment 11:  Use of pandas and numpy for text analysis.  
Assignment 12:  Use of pandas, numpy and json to read in a json file and perform basic analysis on a dataframe.
